# Kasko2go Open source telematic app for Android
## _Description_
The Kasko2go Open source service is developed to determine a driving behaviour of a certain driver. This telematic service works with digitised road maps, has the information on static and dynamic  accident rate of different road sections.
A driver’s smartphone is used as a client telematic device. An accelerometer and a gyroscope, modules of GPS, GSM and Bluetooth systems embedded into a smartphone turn a driver’s smartphone into a source of telematic information. A mobile application installed on the smartphone transmits telematic data to servers for further processing.

## _Application Functionality:_

- Collection and primary processing of telemetry data on vehicle movement taking into account the environmental conditions;
- Evaluation of risk (probability) of causing an accident by a driver.

This free of charge app can be used to create your own app for Android.
